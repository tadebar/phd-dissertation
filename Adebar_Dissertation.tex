% ABSTRACT
%======================================================================
\prefacesection{Abstract}
Liver cancer is a significant health concern worldwide. While surgery, either resection or transplantation, is the only curative treatment of liver cancer, approximately three-quarters of patients are ineligible. Percutaneous ablation of liver tumors is a common, less invasive alternative treatment. Current techniques for ablation of liver tumors suffer from significant limitations, primarily the inability to reach tumors in certain regions of the liver and tumors blocked by sensitive anatomy. Also, treatment of larger tumors requires multiple punctures of the liver capsule, with each puncture increasing the risk of hemorrhage.

Robotic needle steering is a technique for inserting flexible needles along controlled, curved paths through tissue. Applying robotic needle steering in percutaneous ablation of liver tumors could potentially allow clinicians to correct for errors during insertion, steer around obstacles to previously unreachable targets, and reach multiple targets from a single insertion site. To date, however, robotic needle steering has existed solely as a research concept. Although many relevant methods and algorithms have been described, experimental validation has largely been limited to artificial tissues and tightly controlled bench-top settings yielding best-case results. The goal of this thesis was to move robotic needle steering closer to the clinical domain, by solving several technical problems specific to percutaneous ablation of liver tumors.

Clinical application of robotic needle steering necessitates real-time medical imaging methods that can resolve the configuration of the steerable needle inside the body. Ultrasound imaging is a logical modality to apply since it is fast, safe, and inexpensive; however, traditional B-mode imaging is known to produce poor needle visibility, resulting in a difficult segmentation problem. To overcome this difficulty, a method for automatically segmenting a steerable needle from 3D ultrasound data is proposed, which uses mechanical vibration of the steerable needle to make it visible in power Doppler image data. Validation of this technique shows that it is accurate to within 1-2~mm in \textit{ex vivo} liver tissue.

Techniques for steering needles have generally been validated in artificial tissues rather than actual biological tissues, making it questionable whether they could achieve sufficient curvature to be useful in ablation of liver tumors. A workspace analysis is described, which uses medical image analysis to set a procedure-specific requirement of 50~mm or less for radius of curvature. Motivated by this analysis, finite-element and experimental studies are described, and demonstrate that average radius of curvature of approximately 50~mm can be achieved in liver tissue through optimization of bent-tip geometry. An articulated-tip design, which uses a miniaturized cable-driven rotary joint to articulate a distal section between bent and straight, is also presented. This design achieves smaller radius of curvature compared to bent-tip needles described in previous work.

To allow closed-loop control of a needle steering robot based on noisy Doppler ultrasound measurements, a recursive estimation scheme based on an unscented Kalman filter is proposed. Simulations and experimental needle steering trials in \textit{ex vivo} liver tissue samples show that this estimation scheme allows a robot to autonomously place steerable needle tips with an average error of approximately 2~mm in a bench-top setting.

Finally, a complete pre-clinical system for image-guided needle steering is presented, which combines the described methods for imaging, estimation and needle design with an existing control scheme. This system uses freehand 3D ultrasound imaging, and allows a clinician user to manually visualize target anatomy while simultaneously providing image feedback for automatic control. Validation testing in a porcine cadaver is described, in which simulated targets are introduced into the liver and the system is used to place the steerable needle tip at the targets. Accuracy of the tip placement is measured using radiographic imaging, and ranges from clinically acceptable to unacceptable depending on the difficulty of the target.

\prefacesection{Acknowledgements}
I would like to thank my advisor, Dr.\ Allison Okamura, for taking a chance on an unknown Canadian, bringing me to Stanford, and supporting my research. I feel very fortunate to have learned from such a positive, hardworking professional, who also plays hockey. Thanks to my other reading committee members, Dr.\ Mark Cutkosky and Dr.\ Steve Rock, for their time and interest in my work. Thanks also to Dr.\ Pierre Khuri-Yakub and Dr.\ Gloria Hwang for sitting on my defense committee. 

I gratefully acknowledge my funding sources. The National Institutes of Health (NIH) have supported our work through a Research Project Grant (EB01884901), and through the Zeego Lab Shared Instrument Grant (S10RR026714-01). I was also fortunate enough to be partially supported by a National Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC) PGS-D fellowship while at Stanford.   

As part of our lab's needle steering project team, I have worked with some outstanding colleagues and collaborators. Dr.\ Tom Wedlick and Dr.\ Ann Majewicz paved the way for me, and helped me get started. Dr.\ Gloria Hwang and Dr.\ Paul Laeseke were our clinical champions at Stanford, and their  contributions have had a profound impact on our project and my PhD experience. A special thumbs-up to Joey Greer, who I have been lucky to have as my partner in crime over the last few years.

I think the best compliment I can pay Allison as an advisor is to point out the exceptional group of outgoing, intelligent, positive graduate students (myself excluded) she has assembled. My CHARM Lab family has defined my experience at Stanford; the thought of leaving them makes writing this dissertation quite bittersweet. In addition to some decent research, we have produced an extremely large amount of cheese over the last four years. There are too many good friends to call out individually, but I will give props to my long-term officemates, Tania `Lil-Mo' Morimoto, Michele `MiRo' Rotella, and Nick `Nick' Colonnese. 

This section would not be complete without a paragraph dedicated to Kirk `Pickles' Nichols. I have had the honor of spending about two thirds of the last three years within ten feet of Kirk. He has been my roommate, officemate, labmate, classmate, fellow intern, dog uncle, and occasional workout partner. I have also greatly enjoyed our work founding several Stanford student groups, including the Long-Distance Boyfriends Club, and the Lean Back Society.     

Of course, I have to acknowledge my family. Without them I would both literally and figuratively not be here today. Thanks to my mother, Yvonne, and my sister, Tess. Particular thanks to my father, Dr.\ Perry Adebar, who once said to his indignant young son, ``when you have a PhD in engineering, you can make the rules in the house." Your move, Dad.

My freshly minted wife, Reiko Hoyano, happily turned her life upside down to move to Stanford with me. Throughout this process she, more than anyone else, has supported me, encouraged me, and pushed me to be my best. I am very lucky to have her as the second author on my life story.

Finally, and most importantly of all, I must thank Germany vom Bierstadter Hof SCHH3 for her thoughtful advice, wisdom, and tireless review of this manuscript.

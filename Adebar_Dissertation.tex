% ABSTRACT
%======================================================================
\prefacesection{Abstract}
Liver cancer is a significant health concern worldwide. While surgery, either resection or transplantation, is the only curative treatment of liver cancer, approximately three quarters of patients are ineligible. Percutaneous ablation of liver tumors is a common, less invasive treatment option for these liver cancer patients. Variations include radiofrequency ablation, microwave ablation, and alcohol ablation. Current techniques for ablation of liver tumors suffer from significant limitations, primarily the inability to reach tumors blocked by vulnerable anatomy and tumors in certain regions of the liver. Also, treatment of larger tumors requires multiple punctures of the liver capsule, with each puncture increasing the risk of hemorrhage.

Robotic needle steering is a technique for inserting flexible needles along controlled, curved paths through tissue. Ideally, robotic needle steering would allow clinicians to (1) correct for errors during insertion and reach a target position with superior accuracy compared to manual insertion, (2) steer around obstacles to previously unreachable targets, and (3) reach multiple targets from a single insertion site, thus reducing the risk of complications such as hemorrhage or infection. However, to date, robotic needle steering has existed solely as a research concept. Although many relevant methods and algorithms have been described, experimental validation has largely been limited to artificial tissues, and tightly controlled bench-top settings yielding best-case results. The goal of this thesis was to move robotic needle steering closer to the clinical domain, by targeting a specific percutaneous intervention (ablation of liver tumors), and solving several of the largest technical problems specific to that procedure.

Clinical application of robotic needle steering necessitates real-time medical imaging methods that can resolve the configuration of the steerable needle inside the body. Ultrasound imaging is a logical modality to apply since it is fast, safe, and inexpensive; however, traditional B-mode imaging is known to produce poor needle visibility, resulting in a difficult segmentation problem. To overcome this difficulty, a method for automatic segmentation of a steerable needle from 3D ultrasound data is proposed, which uses mechanical vibration of the steerable needle to make it visible in power Doppler image data. Validation of this technique shows that it is accurate to within 1-2~mm in \textit{ex vivo} liver tissue.

Techniques for steering needles have generally been validated in artificial tissues rather than actual biological tissues, making it questionable whether they could achieve sufficient curvature to be useful in a particular clinical application. A workspace analysis is described, which uses medical image analysis to set a procedure specific requirement for steerable needle curvature in ablation of liver tumors. Results show that radius of curvature of 50~mm or less is necessary to reach the majority of the liver volume from clinically realistic entry vectors. Motivated by this requirement, finite-element and experimental studies are described, to determine whether the required steerable needle curvature can be achieved through optimization of needle tip geometry. Results demonstrate that average radius of curvature of approximately 50~mm can be achieved in liver tissue using the best combination of bent-tip length and bent-tip angle. An articulated-tip mechanism, which uses a miniaturized cable-driven rotary joint to articulate a distal section between bent and straight, is also proposed.

To allow closed-loop control of a steerable needle robot based on noisy Doppler ultrasound measurements, a recursive estimation scheme based on an unscented Kalman filter is proposed. Simulations and experimental needle steering trials in \textit{ex vivo} liver tissue samples show that this estimation scheme allows a robot to autonomously place steerable needle tips with an average error of approximately 2~mm in a bench-top setting.

Finally a complete system for image-guided needle steering is described, combining the described methods for imaging, needle design and control. In a more clinically realistic implementation, this system uses freehand-3D ultrasound imaging, and allows a clinician user to manually visualize target anatomy while simultaneously providing image feedback for automatic control. Validation testing in a porcine cadaver is described, in which simulated targets are introduced into the liver and the system is used to place the steerable needle tip at the target. Accuracy of the final tip placement is measured using radiographic imaging, and ranges from clinically acceptable to clinically unacceptable depending on the difficulty of the target.
